# Translating Lean theorem statements to natural language 

In July 2022, we added natural language translations of theorem statements to the docs.

Expand this, explain properly, etc etc etc. 

## You can help!

These translations are generated with no human oversight.
We expect many of them to be incorrect in various ways.
As a browser of the API docs, you can help by flagging translations that look incorrect. 
A simple "yes" or "no" is useful.
Even better, if you can write a better translation, we can use this to improve the model. 

Don't worry about getting every last detail correct. (?)
